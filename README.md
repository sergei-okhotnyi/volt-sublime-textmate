Installation via Package Control
--------------------------------
If you have Sublime [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/docs/usage), you know what to do. If not, well: it's a package manager for Sublime Text; and it's awesome.

After installing the Package Control and restarting the editor:

* Open the Command Pallete (ctrl+shift+P or cmd+shift+P).
* Type “Install Package” and hit return.
* Find “Volt” and hit return.
